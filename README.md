# Game
This is a simple game without any complicated rules.
The only thing that you have to do is to run away from green lines and red dots.
You can move your player (green octocat) using arrow keys, and jump by presseing the space button.
While the player is jumping, damages will not be inflicted on it.

The codes of the game is written in Python, and utilizes the library Pygame.
